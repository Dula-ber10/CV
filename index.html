<!-- browsers are set to render webpages as unicode which is similar to utf8, if you change encdoing of browser it will result in unreadable jumbled words, you can check encodeing by going to text  encoding ,Right-click on the page. Mouse over "Encoding." In the expanded menu, select "Unicode (UTF-8)."and it will show unicode, if you change it it will change labguage and messupo website-->
<!-- utf8 is what shourd be using as it include all international symbols in unicord charachter set and emojis thats encoded with utf8, check unicode-Tabel.com-->
<!-- sIMPLY COPY PASTE EMIJIS IN THAT WEBSITE TO THE CODE where appropriate-->
<!--utf8 is renderedcorreclty in the maximum chance  in anybrowser-->
<!-- check joe; spoky article on unicode-->
<!-- to restructture code go to packages- atom beutify , itll make indentation automatically-->
<!-- <em> tag </em> and i tag but use em tag BECAUSE IT EMPHASIZES rather than just decorate the text italisized the word, search italisize html mdn -->
<!-- if there aremore than one tag for your requirement like above, use the one that is the strongest and not alsways about structure or styling, also use strong tag instead of b tag to bold because strong is more convinient than b as b is only styling -->
<!-- horizontal rule = HR-->
<!--UL stands for unordered lists essientially a bullet point list-->
<!-- li tag means list item that encloses every bullet pi=oint in the ul tag>=-->
<!-- ordered list is something that would have ABC ,123 etc.. you can lists inside lists -->
<!-- image tag is a self closing tag , you need to specify  source of image -->
<!-- to copy image from internet, roght click and copy image address -->
<!-- structure:    img src ="image address"   alt = ""                -- >
<!--  alt is used, if the browser cant render the image it will display an alternative text to the user to describe what the image was about-->
<!-- This helps browsers like google know the webpage, if you have an image on burito and alternative text is burito img 1, if somone searches up borito your webpage is related and likly to show up -->
<!--  Use PHOTOBUCKET TO UPLAOD PIC OF YOUR SELF AND GET IMAGE ADDRESS-->
<!-- if the website you took the image is down, itll display image not foumd in webpage, to avoid this you can add image into out folder html personal site, then you can give it the file name or location  in src
crop-circle.imageonline.co allows you to crop square image to circle, can be very effective when making portfolios

to give hyperlinks we use anchor tag which is <a href="#"></a>
to open link in new tab press cntrl and press the link
so far we have used hyperlinks to take us to internal(hobbies) sites and external sites(google)

inside table tag we can give table row (tr) and table column
to cretae a hyper link that links a html document inside another html, we create the second html docunt in the same filder as the first, and in the first html file we give the second htlm file name in its href
check line 22  <a href="hobbies.html"></a>
<to represent a cell we ause td tag

<th></th> by default boldes the text wrapped in it

in mdn there are some elements that have thumbs down sighn that means they are deprecated which means
it is downgraded, its something they no longer recommend to use


what needs to be done for webaite:
1. pload pp and round it  like IG
2. at certifications and update the hyper links to thos certifications
